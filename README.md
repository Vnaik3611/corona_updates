I have create a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application. i have used React with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI and many different modules. 

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and i have created cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. Along with it, i have also used Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, API data fetching, all of it in React JS!

The project is fetching the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax and had also used React Hooks!This project gives strong understanding of React's workflow; including data fetching, hooks, folder structure and more.
